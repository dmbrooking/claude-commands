# Claude Code slash commands

This is a work in progress as I learn more about Claude Code and its capabilities. The goal is to create a set of slash commands that can be used to interact with Claude Code in a more efficient way.

- Thanks to [Kieran Klaassen](https://x.com/kieranklaassen) for the inspiration and the initial code snippets.
